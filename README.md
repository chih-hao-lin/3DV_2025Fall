This is the repo that organize the codebase for CS598: 3D Vision at UIUC, 2025 Fall, and it is contributed by all students taking this course. 

## Guideline for code submission
- create folder for the paper, and folder name is `group_[id]_[topic]`.
- create subfolder for each hacker, and folder name is `[NetID]_[title]`.
- Put all the code, data, slides inside the hacker subfolder, and create a `README.md` that describes the hacker info, instruction for setting up the environment and running the script.
- Please refer to `group_00_kinectfusion/shenlong_volume_fusion_2d` as an example.
- Please take a look at the great jobs done by hackers last year [here](https://github.com/chih-hao-lin/3DV_2024Fall).
